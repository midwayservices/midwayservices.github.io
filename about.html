      <section class="post-section" aria-label="Who We Are">
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>I’m the creator of Midway Learning, a computer science student passionate about sharing my learning journey. As a self-taught developer, I understand the challenges of starting from scratch—confusing documentation, overwhelming jargon, and scattered resources. That’s why I started this blog: to provide clear, structured tutorials that I wish I had when I began coding.</p>
        <p>My focus is on <strong>web development</strong> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and <strong>Android development</strong> (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Firebase). I’m constantly learning and experimenting with new tools, and I share my insights through detailed posts, code snippets, and real-world examples. Whether you’re a student, a career-switcher, or a curious beginner, Midway Learning is your space to grow.</p>
